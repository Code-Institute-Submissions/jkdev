## Milestone Project 1 
### User Centric Front-end Development 

### Project Purpose - Who am I?

Who am I? This is a question that plaque most individuals as we grow and adapt throughout our lifetime. It is a "major" question, especially for a child transitioning from childhood to adulthood as they test their boundaries and figure out their sense of self and identity. The aim of this project is twofold.

1. Allow JK to develop awareness of his sense of self, organize his thoughts and belief structure as he builds on his character development.

2. Organizes JK's whole child domain developments into identity groups that will provide educators and school leaders a more comprehensive picture as they consider JK for direct school admission (DSA) into secondary one. 

"Who am I?" is a project with the ultimate goal of placing JK into a secondary school that will fit his personality and the family's values. This is crucial as the teenage stage in secondary school will influence deeply and form the basis of JK's identity as he exits this transitional stage and into adulthood.

Users of this site are educators, senior teachers and school leaders who are **key decision makers** in the outcome of JK's DSA application. The information provided by JK's primary school will be limited to happenings in school and remarks by teachers who have spent time with him - to them, he is a student leader. However, a child only spends half their time at school! This site aims to provide the other side of the coin in a bid to provide key decision makers an **insight** into what drives and motivates JK's behaviour. 

### UX

Users will land on JK's mainpage that subvertly calls them to attention with "Who am I?" and a quote by aristotle. This should ingeniously inform them that this site will let them find out more about JK. JK's developmental domains can be explored by clicking on the icon buttons; whilst scrolling down the page, educators are able to view JK's accomplishements / achievements and awards in the past 3 years.
![Responsive Web Design Demo](images/core/demo.png)
The design of this site aims to be clean, straighforward, organized and uncluttered. The colors and typography used are a personification of JK.
![Color Chart](images/core/colorchart.jpeg)
Extensive use of Grey and Orange across the platform to convey a clean message of JK's personality: balance, warmth, enthusiasm, excitement and neutrality. A contrast color of turquoise adds a touch of sophistication that represents his softer side: tranquility, serenity, and wisdom.
![Font Gylps](images/core/fontgylps.png)
Eczar, serif and Montserrat, san-serif were selected as font-pair that is simple and modern yet suggestive of heritage.

### Features
This site features 3 developmental domain page:
1. Physical - The physical domain covers physical development including health and wellness; a link to strava is included that will show his recent workouts.
2. Cognitive - The Cognitive domain covers his primary interest - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics); a link to scratch is included.
3. Aesthetic - The Aesthetic domain covers his secondary interest

#### Existing Features
1. Feature 1 : Icon Navigation Bar - allows users to jump to specific interest segments.
2. Feature 2 : Drop Down Menu - allows users to go navigate between domain page.
3. Feature 3 : Bottom Page Icon Navigation Bar - allows users to quickly return to specific interest segments.

#### Features Left to Implement

4. Feature 4 : A video intro (self intro video) of JK (similar to college/uni application video).
5. Feature 5 : PDF download for a summary of JK's portfolio which will include school's documentation. DSA schools require result slips of End-of-Year Examination from previous year. (current existing link is functional but will download a sample pdf instead of his portfolio pdf)
6. Feature 6 : Contact me - email form for request of references.
(current existing link opens a google form request)

### Testing

A demo link 
<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. -->

<!-- Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them. -->

<!-- In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. -->

<!-- You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet. -->


### Deployment

<!-- This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku). -->

<!-- In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version -->

<!-- In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally. -->
